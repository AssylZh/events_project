# events_project
This project is a web application (or website) in which events in Almaty are published. There are pages on different pages like concerts, conferences, etc. (in the future, I plan to add more) so websiteÂ visitors will be comfortable with finding necessary events for them. Further, they can see the details like time, and location and register.
